## kaaroScoreboard
In modern day esports, scoreboards are much more than P1 score vs P2 score. Sometimes easy to maintain, but sometimes, showing ball by coverage is just too vital.
* Player Profiles
* Team scorecard
* Tournament structure
* Game Mode
* Timer

And these need to be social.
* Chat/Nightbot access
* Twitch profiles
* Steam profiles 
* Twitter/Instagram Live


Themes can be custom made.
